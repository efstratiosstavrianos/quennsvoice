        <h2>Students Struggle to Succeed on AP Exams</h2>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>
                Advanced Placement (AP) 
                classes can lead to college credits 
                for students who pass the exam, 
                but at Queens Voc students 
                struggle to pass the exam.

                    Of the 69 AP exams taken by 
            Queens Voc students last spring, 
            none scored a five, none scored a 
            Twenty-three students took the AP 
            exam for European History, three 
            students scored a three, earning 
            the college credits, and the other 
            20 scored a one. In AB Calculus, 
            18 students took the AP exam, 16 
            scored a one, one student scored 
            a two, and one student scored a 
            three, earning college credits. In 
            AP Physics, 11 students took the 
            exam, eight students scored a one 
            and three scored a two.

                Each AP exam score is a 
            weighted combination of the 
            student’s scores on the multiplechoice section and the free 
            response section. The final score 
            is reported on a five-point scale. 
            Obtaining a three is passing, 
            anything lower than a three is 
            failing and no college credit if 
            given. There aren’t many students 
            who have taken the AP exam and 
            passed with more than a two,” said 
            Mr. Gorman, assistant principal of 
            the Math and Science Department. 
            Nevertheless, he said, “It shows a 
            great deal of effort when a student 
            takes the class because it helps 
            develop academic scores.”

                Last year, Queens Voc offered 
            five AP classes: Psychology taught
            four, four students scored a three, 
            four students scored a two, and 
            61 students scored a one. Four 
            students earned the college credits 
            from the exam.
            Last spring, six students took 
            the AP exam for Art History 
            and all scored a one. Eleven 
            students took the AP Psychology 
            exam, and again all scored a one.
